        <p>
            So a lot of people I see are always confused about how to write tech tutorials. In my recent assignment <br>
            from my class, we had an assignment to do a technical writing and write a tech tutorial.<br>
             At first, it seemed extremely difficult to think about a topic, making sure you’re good<br>
              at it, and then doing a whole tutorial on it.Today, I’ll share some of the tips that help <br>
              me write tech tutorials. 

        </p>
          <h2>CHOOSE ONE TOPIC, AND FOCUS ON THAT ONLY: 
        </h2>
          <p>
            This is the most important part of the tutorial, the topic of your tutorial 
            should be clear <br>
             so it is clear and easy for the reader to read and understand.
             Stay away from broad topics,<br>
              and try to narrow your topic so it’s easier to explain. <br>
              After you decide your topic, think about why the reader should learn this topic,<br>
               what would they create in the tutorial. These questions are important to ask yourself<br>
                before you move on. Try to keep things simple. Make sure you know what you’re doing,<br>
                 before teaching others.
          </p>
          <h2>THE CODE:
        </h2>
          <p>
            If it’s a tech tutorial then it would definitely require code. Your code sample has to be <br>
            very well-formatted and concise so the reader knows what is happening. Your code plays a really<br>
             important role in your tech tutorial, because it exactly shows what you’re trying to make the reader understand.
             <br> You need to have clean code to improve the reader’s readability and it needs to be precise because usually
             <br> the reader copy pastes the code, so your code needs to be accurate but precise.
          </p>
          <h2>THE OUTLINE OF YOUR TUTORIAL: </h2>
          <p>You want your tutorial to be friendly but formal. Try to not use “We will build” “I will do this”,<br>
             try using “You will build” as this sounds like the reader is doing it. Then when you have your code,<br>
              and the topic, think about your audience, who is your audience? Is it for a beginner programmer,<br>
               intermediate? Be more clear to the reader. When writing the steps, make sure that you provide a brief <br>
               description before you put a code snippet, and explain why this is important to do and how this relates<br>
                to the actual goal of the tutorial. After you’re done with all the steps, it’s time for the conclusion.<br>
                 The conclusion should summarise what the reader has accomplished by following this tutorial, you could <br>
                 also tell the reader what they can do next after learning what you taught them. 
        </p>
        <h2>SHARE YOUR ARTICLE:</h2>
        <p>Now it’s time to share your article, make sure to get rid of all the errors before you share it. Find good 
            <br>
            credible websites to share your article. Think about your audience, what do you think is a good platform <br>
            to use? Is Facebook good? Twitter? If that’s the answer then publish it!</p>
