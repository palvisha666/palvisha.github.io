        <h2><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
        <p>
           
        Figma is one of the most prominent web-based graphic editing, prototyping and user interface design <br>
        applications. Figma is different as compared to the other design softwares, as it is very easily accessible,<br>
         and has a collaboration feature which lets you collaborate with other team members.<br>
          Figma can be used to do all kinds of design work, from graphic design to making high-fidelity screens<br>
           and designing websites, mobile app interfaces, and for making prototypes for your app or website.
        </p>
        <p>In this tutorial we are going to use Figma Design tool to create 2 views for our fitness app!<br>
             A get started view and a login view. This tutorial is for Figma designers who are beginners<br>
              who want to learn some basics.
              </p>
        <p>The idea of our fitness app is very simple. The ‘Get Started’ page would have a background image,<br>
             with a logo and a text including a ‘Get Started’ button. The login view is so that  users should <br>
             be able to login easily and fast.
        </p>

          <h2><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>To complete this tutorial, you will need:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Access to a computer.</li>
            <li>Need an account on Figma 
            which you can easily make by going to the<br>
             Figma website, clicking “Sign up”, and then entering your details. </li>
        </ul>
         <p>So let's dive in and create our first project!</p>
         
             <p><strong>1. Creating a new file.</strong></p>
             <p>To start with this tutorial, you need to create an empty file. Once we have created our <strong>‘New File’</strong>,
                <br> we can go ahead and get started by developing the frames for our fitness app. 
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot__1" width="700" height="500"src=../Assets/screenshot1.png>
            <p class="title__1"><strong>2. Developing design frames. </strong></p>
            <p class="step__2">In the top left of the tool bar, we see that there is a ‘Frame’ tool.<br>
                 Once we select this, we see that there are a lot of options from which we <br>
                 could use any design frame we like. I’m going to use iPhone 11 pro, but you can create<br>
                  the prototype of this app with any design frame you prefer.</p>
        <img class="screenshot__2" width="700" height="500"src=../Assets/screenshot__2.png>
        <p class="title__2"><strong>3. Copying frames. </strong></p>
        <p class="step__3">Once we have our frames selected we copy that frame one more time, so we have <br>
            them all side by side. 
        </p>
        <img class="screenshot__3" width="700" height="500"src=../Assets/screenshot__3.png>
        <p class="title__3"><strong>4. Setting the background image, logo and logo text. </strong></p>
        <p class="step__4">First we are going to select a background image to our ‘Get started’ view, <br>
            and the image that I’m going to be using is from Unsplash, and I’m also going to add a logo<br>
             image here which is an SVG that I picked from Flaticon.</p> 
             <img class="screenshot__4" width="700" height="500"src=../Assets/screenshot4.png>
             <p class="morestep">Once you have found your image, and logo, you can drag and drop to the Figma page and<br>
                 crop it or resize it so that it could fit the screen. You can also edit the image the<br>
                  way you like, here I added a drop shadow at the top, to make the image look more faded.<br>
                   You can add the drop shadow by using the ‘Fill’ option on the side, and can increase or<br>
                    decrease the shadow while also setting the color. I did a linear drop shadow with black 100%.<br>
                      Now we’ve added our title of the app, and the logo SVG and the title of the app. You can add<br>
                       the title of the app by using the ‘T’ option on the left side of the tool bar. I’m using Nunito<br>
                        bold 36px font for the app logo text. Feel free to play about with different fonts or even a logo.
            </p>
            <p class="title__4"><strong>5. Creating the ‘Get Started’ button. </strong></p>
            <p class="step__5">Next up is our “Get Started” button, for that we need to create a rectangle,<br>
                 adjust its corner radius which you can do on the right side of the menu, I have my corner<br>
                  radius set to 25 but you can do anything you prefer. Then, we will change the fill color to<br>
                   black so it could match our theme. 
            </p> 
            <img class="screenshot__5" width="700" height="500"src=../Assets/screenshot5.png>
            <p class="step__6">I increased the corner radius and added text, I’m using Nunito bold 18px. <br>
                After I added the text, I searched for an arrow icon that I got from Flaticon, copied it, <br>
                and pasted it right next to the ‘Get Started’ text.</p>
            <p class="login">Now for our second view, the ‘Login View’.</p>
            <p class="title__5"><strong>1. Adding the logo, logo text, and a statement.</strong></p>
            <img class="screenshot__6" width="700" height="500"src=../Assets/screenshot6.png>
            <p class="step__7">First, we are going to set the background color of the frame to black<br>
                 which could be done by using the ‘Fill’ tool to add color. I added a similar drop shadow<br>
                  that I did before on the previous screen. I added a linear white drop shadow here with 40%. <br>
                  Then we’ll drag and drop our SVG logo, resize it so it fits the screen, and then place it at <br>
                  the top with the same logo text we had on the first page. I added a logo statement at the bottom <br>
                   that matches our app, but you can add any statement you prefer. </p>
                   <p class="title__6"><strong>2. Adding input fields to the screen. </strong></p>
                   <img class="screenshot__7" width="700" height="500"src=../Assets/screenshot7.png>
                   <p class="step__8">Next up we are adding input fields to the view, for that we need to draw<br>
                     two squares under the statement and then adjust the corner radius from the menu to the right side.<br>
                      The corner radius I have over here is 20, but you can choose any. Once we have them drawn, we can <br>
                      fill the rectangles with white, and add the ‘username’ ‘password’ field with a lighter grey color <br>
                      and place the text into the rectangles.  </p>
                      <p class="step__9">
                        Then, we create a ‘Login’ button which is slightly smaller than the other two, and fill it with <br>
                        white as well. Next, I put ‘Login’ text in black using the same font.
                   </p> 
                   <p class="step__10">
                    Lastly, I placed some more text under the ‘Login’ button, and added ‘Forgot your password’<br>
                     so that users could reset their password if they need to.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="step__11">
                        Now we have 2 views that we can use to show our app idea or collaborate with other team members!
                        </p> 
                        <p class="step__12">
                            Figma is such an amazing and easy to use designing and prototyping tool that could be used by <br>
                            graphic designers, UI, UX, software developer or web designers. Now that we’re done with our 3 views,<br>
                             we could use our app idea and share it with other team members, and can collaborate as well by using <br>
                             the ‘Share’ button on top right of your project. 

                            </p> 
                            <p class="step__13">
                                I hope you found this tutorial useful, and learned a few basics from this!
                            </p>
